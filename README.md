## Abstract

Observations of coronal loops at the periphery of active regions have been found to be
steady, lasting much longer than a radiative cooling time, and near-isothermal at
approximately 1.5 MK. These relatively steady and high-density structures cannot be
explained by either hydrostatic loop simulations or impulsive nanoflare heating and thus
pose a challenge to existing heating models. In this presentation, we present Hinode EIS
and SDO AIA observations of such loop structures from NOAA 11575 as observed on 29
September 2012. From these observations, we compute density diagnostics, emission
measure distributions, filter ratios and time lags of the isolated loop structures.
Additionally, we present model results from hydrodynamic simulations of these loop
structures for several different heating scenarios, include steady uniform heating,
stratified footpoint heating, and impulsive heating. From our model results, we derive
density and temperature diagnostics in order to constrain the parameter space of feasible
heating models using our observations. Comparing our observations and model results,
we find that none of our proposed heating scenarios is able to fully reproduce the set of
observed diagnostics and that in particular, the derived densities are most difficult to
reproduce. We discuss these results in the context of current approaches to modeling
energy release in loops in quiescent active regions.
